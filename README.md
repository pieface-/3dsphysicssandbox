# 3ds Physics Sandbox v0.3 alpha
An application for messing with physics on the 3ds

###Current Features:  
- Manipulate multiple different sized squares with the stylus
- Objects will bounce off of each other  
- The squares are affected by gravity, with walls, and friction  
- Modifiable gravity, collision elasticity, and friction values  
- Take a screenshot
- Control gravity by tilting 3ds (accelerometer)
- Move camera with circle pad
- Walls that squares will bounce off of
- different squares and walls can be made using on screen ui

###Possible plans for the Future:  
- Fix Banner Sound (Warning: sound may be irritable)
- Save and load state to and from file (coming v0.4)
- Different kinds of objects (like circles or custom shapes)  
- Proper implementation of forces/momentum and vectors  
- Tension and ropes  
- Develop into physics library
- 3D physics

###Building:  
This requires sf2dlib and expects the libsf2d directory to be in the same directory as 3dsphysicssandbox.  
Just run the makefile to build.
