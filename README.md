# 3ds Physics Sandbox
An application for messing with physics on the 3ds

###Current Features:  
- Manipulate a single 50 by 50 pixel square with the stylus  
- The square is affected by gravity, collisions, and friction  
- Modifiable gravity, collision elasticity, and friction values  

###Possible plans for the Future:  
- More than one object  
- Fix friction behavior
- Different kinds of objects (like circles or custom shapes)  
- Proper implementation of forces and vectors  
- Tension and ropes  
- Create .cia and banner  

###Building:  
This requires sf2dlib and expects the libsf2d directory to be in the same directory as 3dsphysicssandbox.  
Just run the makefile to build.
